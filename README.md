# Celebal Internship – Week 1 Python Assignments

This repository contains solutions for the Week 1 Python assignments provided during my internship at Celebal Technologies. The tasks are beginner-friendly and focus on strengthening Python basics such as conditionals, functions, strings, and iterators.

## ✅ Problems Covered

1. **py-if-else** – Uses conditional statements to print different outputs based on a given number.
2. **python-arithmetic-operators** – Performs basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **compress-the-string** – Compresses a string by counting consecutive characters using `itertools.groupby()`.
4. **the-minion-game** – A game to generate substrings and calculate scores based on starting letters.
5. **write-a-function** – Defines reusable blocks of code using the `def` keyword.
6. **word-order** – Counts word occurrences while maintaining input order.
7. **iterables-and-iterators** – Solves problems using iterators and combinations from `itertools`.
8. **python-tuples** – Uses tuples and demonstrates how they are immutable.
9. **finding-the-percentage** – Calculates average marks of a student from a given dataset.
10. **python-string-formatting** – Shows string formatting and alignment for clean output.
